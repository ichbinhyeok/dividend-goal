                <p class="lead">
                    I built <strong>Money First</strong> because I was tired of financial tools that cared more about
                    showing me ads and getting my email address than answering my actual questions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Like many of you, I wanted to understand the simple math behind my financial goals: <em>"How much
                        capital do I need to generate $500 a month?"</em> But every site I visited was cluttered,
                    complicated, or required a signup just to run a simple calculation. Use this tool to get straight
                    answers without the noise.
                </p>

                <hr class="my-5">

                <h2 class="h4 fw-bold mb-3">What This Site Focuses On</h2>
                <p>
                    Money First is dedicated to <strong>dividend math translation</strong>. It does not provide
                    investment advice, stock picks, or market predictions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My goal is to take public, static yield data and translate it into a tangible "lifestyle cost"
                    context. Instead of just seeing a percentage, you see what that percentage means for your monthly
                    bills. This helps bridge the gap between abstract financial metrics and real-world goals.
                </p>

                <h2 class="h4 fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">Data Transparency & Privacy</h2>
                <p>
                    Trust is earned by NOT tracking you. Here is exactly how this site works:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No User Tracking:</strong> I do not use tools to record your session or map your
                        behavior.</li>
                    <li><strong>No Personal Data:</strong> This calculator has no database for user inputs. Nothing you
                        type is saved or sent to a third party.</li>
                    <li><strong>Server-Side Math:</strong> All calculations happen instantly on the server using a
                        static dataset. This means the site is fast, lightweight, and completely stateless.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2 class="h4 fw-bold mt-5 mb-3">Who This Tool Is For</h2>
                <p>
                    This tool is designed for <strong>U.S.-based users</strong> who are in the educational phase of
                    their financial journey.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>It <strong>IS</strong> for you if you want to understand the mechanics of dividend yields and
                        goal setting.</li>
                    <li>It <strong>IS NOT</strong> for you if you are looking for real-time trading data or professional
                        investment recommendations.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Please consult with a certified financial planner or fiduciary before making any investment
                    decisions. Financial planning is personal, and this tool only provides general mathematical models.
                </p>
